# Main()

This repository is a collection of project and research ideas that I’m passionate about but may not have the capacity to fully pursue at the moment. I’m sharing these ideas with the community in the hope that they might inspire others. If you find any of these ideas helpful and decide to use or build upon them, I kindly ask that you acknowledge the original source with a citation. Thank you!
